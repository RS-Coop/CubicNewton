# Regularized Saddle-Free Newton (R-SFN)

[Cooper Simpson](https://rs-coop.github.io/)

A Julia implementation of the R-SFN algorithm: a second-order method for unconstrained non-convex optimization. To that end, we consider a problem of the following form
$$\min_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n}f(\mathbf{x})$$
where $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is a twice continuously differentiable function. Each iteration applies an update of the following form:
$$\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(k)}-\alpha\Big(\big(\nabla^2f(\mathbf{x}^{(k)})\big)^2+\lambda^{(k)}\mathbf{I}\Big)^{-1/2} \nabla f(\mathbf{x}^{(k)})$$
where the regularization term is $\lambda^{(k)}\propto\|\nabla^2f(\mathbf{x}^{(k)})\|$. The matrix inverse square root is computed via a quadrature approximation of the following identity:
$$\mathbf{A}^{-1/2}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\big(t^2\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{A}\big)^{-1}\ dt$$
where $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a matrix with strictly positive spectrum, i.e $\sigma(\mathbf{A})\subset\mathbb{R}_{+ +}$.

This repository can be cited using the entry in `CITATION`. See [Publications](#publications) for a full list of publications related to R-SFN and influencing this package. If any of these are useful to your own work, please cite them individually.

## Installation
This package can be installed just like any other Julia package. From the terminal, after starting the Julia REPL, run the following:
```julia
julia> ]
pkg> add RSFN
```
This will install R-SFN and its direct dependencies, but in order to use the package you must install one of the following sets of packages for automatic differentiation (AD):
- `Enzyme.jl`
- `ReverseDiff.jl` and `ForwardDiff.jl`
- `Zygote.jl` and `ForwardDiff.jl`

### Testing
To test the package, run the following command in the REPL:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.test(test_args=[<specific tests>])
```

## Usage
Load the package as usual:
```julia
using RSFN
```
which will export the struct `RSFNOptimizer` and the `minimize!` function. Then load your AD packages, which will export a subtype of `HvpOperator`. Say you load Enzyme:
```julia
using Enzyme
```
then the `EHvpOperator` will be available.

Let's look at a two dimensional Rosenbrock example:
```julia
function rosenbrock(x)
		res = 0.0
		for i = 1:size(x,1)-1
				res += 100*(x[i+1]-x[i]^2)^2 + (1-x[i])^2
		end
		return res
end

x = [0.0, 0.0]

opt = RSFNOptimizer(size(x,1))

minimize!(opt, x, rosenbrock, itmax=10)
```
